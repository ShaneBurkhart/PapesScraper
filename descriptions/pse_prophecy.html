<p>
At PSE we made a bold prediction. We predicted that you wanted to shoot the fastest single-cam bow ever made...so we made it happen!
The Prophecy is everything you want in a single-cam and more. It's smooth, it's accurate, and oh yeah, it smacks down those other guys' single-cam bow by shooting a lightning-quick 340 fps. It's the ultimate single-cam bow for the ultimate Bowhunter.
Prophecy fulfilled!
