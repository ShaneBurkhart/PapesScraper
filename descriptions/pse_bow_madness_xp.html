You've seen Mark and Terry Drury on television, and you know that they never quit. They never stop hanging stands, checking trail cameras, and shooting great whitetails. The Drury's expect their equipment to be just as hardcore as they are, and that is why nothing less than the Bow Madness XP could every carry the Drury name.
Engineered to be smooth, fast and forgiving, the Bow Madness XP is quite simply the best whitetail bow ever built.
