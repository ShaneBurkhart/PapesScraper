Why would PSE replace a legendary bow like the PSE Brute? Because we stepped up and made it lighter, faster, and added the most adjustable single-cam ever!
Meet the PSE Surge! From its lightweight and incredibly stable split limb design, to its hard-hitting single-cam system, the Surge is the new standard for performance in economical bows. Ready to Shoot (RTS) includes Gemini Sight, Whisker Biscuit Rest, Flexxtech Stabilizer, Shadow Quiver, PSE Neoprene Sling, Peep Sight, and Nock Loop.
