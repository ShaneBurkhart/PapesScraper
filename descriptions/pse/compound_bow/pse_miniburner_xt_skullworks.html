At PSE we don't make kiddie bows; we want to make sure that even the youngest hunter has a compound bow that rocks it out! That's why we made the Mini Burner XT. With the new adjustable Vision cam system and Mini SF limb tech, this bow is designed to grow with your young hunter...switching from constant peak weight to grow-with-you adjustments, all without the need for a bow press!
