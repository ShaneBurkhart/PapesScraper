Real shooters don't compromise and neither does PSE. In the past, shooters who wanted a highly adjustable bow had to sacrifice features and performance, but PSE doesn't play that game.
The new Vision compound bow gives you the extreme adjustability in draw length and draw weight you've been asking for, all the while being lighter, more stable, and delivering outstanding performance.
