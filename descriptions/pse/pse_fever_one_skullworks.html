Anything worth doing is worth doing right, so when you bring a young hunter into the sport of archery you don't just want them to try it...you want them to catch the Fever!
That's why PSE developed the new Fever One. Specially designed to fit small-framed archers, the Fever One features an exceptionally fast single-cam design that delivers the speed and accuracy young hunters need to find success in the field.
