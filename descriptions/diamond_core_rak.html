Diamond Archery has introduced the latest R.A.K. Equipped bow for the bowhunter on a budget. The Core has separated itself from its peers by redefining what it means to have a smooth draw in a durable bow you can absolutely rely on. The Core only weighs 3.2 pounds with an axle-to-axle length of 31 inches and a brace height of 7.25 inches. The draw length ranges from 25-30 inches and the draw weight can be set from 40 all the way to 70 pounds. Rotating modules make the draw length adjustable without replacing the cams.

The Core ships R.A.K. Equipped, which means it is ready to shoot right out of the box. Included is a 3-Pin Apex Sight, Octane Capture Arrow Rest, Octane DeadLock Lite Quiver, Comfort Wrist Sling, Alloy Peep, BCY String Loop, and a 5" Ultra-Lite Octane Stabilizer.
